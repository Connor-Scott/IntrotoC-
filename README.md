# Data Science Portfolio Project: Applied Programming in C++

## Project Overview

This portfolio project showcases a series of applications developed in C++, highlighting my ability to apply fundamental programming concepts in a practical context. The applications focus on user interaction, data manipulation, and error handling, demonstrating my proficiency in creating efficient, user-friendly programs. This project is intended for recruiters and grad school reviewers interested in my applied data science and programming skills.

## Project Details

### 1. Rectangular Prism Volume Calculator (`rect.cpp`)

This application prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism and calculates its volume. It demonstrates my ability to handle user input/output operations, implement control structures for input validation, and use recursion for error handling.

### 2. Interactive Fruit Ordering System (`fruit.cpp`)

This application simulates an interactive fruit ordering system. It showcases my ability to design and implement functions, handle problematic user input (non-numerical, over ordering, fractional orders), and produce formatted output. The system uses recursion to handle invalid user entries and constants to define fruit prices and maximum inventory quantities.

### 3. Theater Ticket Sales System (`tickets.cpp`)

This application simulates a theater ticket sales system, allowing users to select seats, calculate ticket prices, and view updated seating arrangements. It demonstrates my ability to use 2D arrays for data storage, functions for complex price calculations, loops for user input validation, and formatted output for user-friendly interaction.

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, or MSVC).
- A development environment such as VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-intro-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cpp-intro-projects
```
3. Compile the desired project using g++ (or another compiler):
```
g++ volume_calculator.cpp -o volume
```
4. Run the compiled file:
```
./volume
```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. This process can be repeated for the other applications (`fruit.cpp` and `tickets.cpp`).
