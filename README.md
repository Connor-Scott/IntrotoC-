# Data Science Portfolio Project: Applied Programming in C++

## Project Overview

This portfolio project presents a collection of C++ applications, demonstrating the application of fundamental programming concepts to practical, user-focused tasks. The programs highlight skills in user interaction, data manipulation, and error handling, showcasing the ability to create efficient, user-friendly software. This project is designed for recruiters and grad school reviewers interested in evaluating applied data science and programming skills.

## Project Details

### 1. Rectangular Prism Volume Calculator (`rect.cpp`)

This application prompts the user for the dimensions of a rectangular prism and calculates its volume. It showcases skills in handling user input/output operations, implementing control structures for input validation, and using recursion for error handling.

### 2. Interactive Fruit Ordering System (`fruit.cpp`)

This application simulates an interactive fruit ordering system, demonstrating the ability to design and implement functions, handle various types of problematic user input (non-numerical, over ordering, fractional orders), and produce neatly formatted output. The system employs recursion to handle invalid user entries and uses constants to define fruit prices and maximum inventory quantities.

### 3. Theater Ticket Sales System (`tickets.cpp`)

This application simulates a theater ticket sales system, enabling users to select seats, calculate ticket prices, and view updated seating arrangements. It exhibits the ability to use 2D arrays for data storage, functions for complex price calculations, loops for user input validation, and formatted output for user-friendly interaction.

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, or MSVC).
- A development environment such as VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-intro-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cpp-intro-projects
```
3. Compile the desired project using g++ (or another compiler):
```
g++ volume_calculator.cpp -o volume
```
4. Run the compiled file:
```
./volume
```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. This process can be repeated for the other applications (`fruit.cpp` and `tickets.cpp`).
