# Data Science Portfolio Project: Practical Applications of Programming in C++

## Project Overview

This portfolio project showcases a series of C++ applications that demonstrate the practical application of fundamental programming concepts. The applications emphasize user interaction, data manipulation, and error handling, illustrating the ability to develop efficient, user-friendly software. This project is specifically tailored for recruiters and graduate school reviewers seeking to evaluate applied data science and programming skills.

## Project Details

### 1. Rectangular Prism Volume Calculator (`rect.cpp`)

This application prompts the user to input the dimensions of a rectangular prism and subsequently calculates its volume. It exemplifies proficiency in managing user input/output operations, implementing control structures for input validation, and utilizing recursion for error handling.

### 2. Interactive Fruit Ordering System (`fruit.cpp`)

This application emulates an interactive fruit ordering system, showcasing the capacity to design and implement functions, manage various types of problematic user input (non-numerical, over ordering, fractional orders), and generate neatly formatted output. The system employs recursion to handle invalid user entries and utilizes constants to define fruit prices and maximum inventory quantities.

### 3. Theater Ticket Sales System (`tickets.cpp`)

This application simulates a theater ticket sales system, enabling users to select seats, calculate ticket prices, and view updated seating arrangements. It demonstrates the ability to use 2D arrays for data storage, functions for complex price calculations, loops for user input validation, and formatted output for user-friendly interaction.

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, or MSVC).
- A development environment such as VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-intro-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cpp-intro-projects
```
3. Compile the desired project using g++ (or another compiler):
```
g++ volume_calculator.cpp -o volume
```
4. Run the compiled file:
```
./volume
```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program. This process can be repeated for the other applications (`fruit.cpp` and `tickets.cpp`).
