# Data Science Portfolio Project: C++ Programming Applications

## Project Overview

This portfolio project presents a series of applications developed in C++, demonstrating proficiency in fundamental programming concepts. These include input/output operations, control structures, functions, arrays, and error handling. The project is aimed at recruiters and grad school reviewers who are interested in the author's data science skills, particularly in applied programming.

## Project Details

### 1. Volume Calculator (`rect.cpp`)

This application calculates the volume of a rectangular prism based on user input. It exemplifies the use of `cin` for user input and `cout` for formatted output. It also showcases the use of conditional statements for input validation and recursion for error handling.

### 2. Fruit Ordering System (`fruit.cpp`)

This application simulates a fruit ordering system, demonstrating the use of functions, user input validation, recursion, and formatted output. The system is designed to handle problematic user input, such as non-numerical input, over ordering, and fractional orders.

### 3. Theater Ticket Sales System (`tickets.cpp`)

This application simulates a theater ticket sales system, allowing users to purchase tickets, track sales, and view seating arrangements. It demonstrates the use of 2D arrays for seat storage, functions for price calculations, loops for user input validation, and formatted output using `setprecision()`.

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, or MSVC).
- A development environment such as VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
