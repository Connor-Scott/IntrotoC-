# Data Science Portfolio Project: C++ Programming Applications

## Project Overview

This portfolio project showcases a collection of applications developed using C++ as part of an introductory programming course. The applications demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as input/output operations, control structures, functions, arrays, and error handling. The project is targeted towards recruiters and grad school reviewers interested in the author's applied data science skills.

## Project Details

### 1. Volume Calculator

This application computes the volume of a rectangular prism based on user input. It demonstrates the use of `cin` for user input, `cout` for formatted output, conditional statements for input validation, and recursion for error handling.

#### Key File: `rect.cpp`

### 2. Fruit Ordering System

This application simulates a fruit ordering system. It demonstrates the use of functions, user input validation, recursion, and formatted output. The application also handles problematic user input such as non-numerical input, over ordering, and fractional orders.

#### Key File: `fruit.cpp`

### 3. Theater Ticket Sales System

This application simulates a theater ticket sales system. It allows users to purchase tickets, track sales, and display seating arrangements. The application demonstrates the use of 2D arrays for seat storage, functions for price calculations, loops for user input validation, and formatted output using `setprecision()`.

#### Key File: `tickets.cpp`

## Reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, or MSVC).
- A development environment such as VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
